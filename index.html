            <h2>Biography</h2>
            
            <p>At the moment, I’m a developer advocate on Google’s Chrome team in Munich, Germany.

                From January 2010 to November 2011, I was part of the team responsible for the web presence of one of the largest daily newspapers in Germany: Sueddeutsche.de. It’s a big site, running on a surprisingly antiquated backend; we work hard to keep things running smoothly, and to meet the high expectations of our users. Generally, we did a pretty good job of it.

        <p>The Followbright team is absolutely fantastic to work with and I would highly recommend them no matter what type of project you have. To find a team of individuals that are responsive, fun to work with, creative, pragmatic, mindful of a client's budget and schedule, and extremely knowledgeable in PHP, SQL, Linux and Apache based web development, strategy, design, marketing and functionality is extremely rare.</p>
